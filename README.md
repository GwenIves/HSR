#Historical Stony Road

An unofficial continuation of the Historical Stony Road (http://www.stonyroad.de/) mod for the Paradox Interactive's game Hearts of Iron 2.


The mod is intended to increase realism of the simulation and raise the difficulty for the human player. A large number of new events was added to the game to highlight the historic setting. The focus of the mod is on Germany but other nations offer interesting and challenging play as well. Through a combination of altered combat modifiers (eg. weather and terrain bonuses/penalties) and difficulty adjustments, it should be extremely unlikely for a human player (on the highest difficulty setting) to achieve a quick, ahistoric success - ie. Soviet Union won't fall to a blitzkrieg offensive, Japan will not be able to knock out Nationalist China before the beginning of Pacific hostilities against the Allies and UK will fight for its bare survival without any hope of defeating Germany before the entrance of USA into the war.


## Installation instructions
  1. Install Hearts of Iron 2
  2. Install the Doomsday and Armageddon expansions
  3. Copy the contents of the mod/ directory into the expansion directory of your installation (in most cases, this will be called Armageddon, but can also be Doomsday, eg. if installed from Steam). The mod already contains the latest patch, it's not necessary to install it separately
  4. Create a shortcut to HoI2.exe in the expansion directory
  5. Modify the properties of the shortcut adding "HSR" (without the quotes) to the end of the Target value
  6. Use this shortcut to launch the game to load the mod


## House rules suggestions

The principal purpose of the mod is to increase the difficulty for the human player. There are four main ways of achieving this end:
  * More realistic combat modifiers. These will make offensives in bad weather/terrain costly to doomed and largely limit major combat operations to areas of good infrastructure/flat terrain and times of good weather.
  * A number of events that prop up computer players in critical moments (eg. giving Soviet Union free, though frozen, units for the 2nd and 3rd defense lines as Germany advances toward Moscow).
  * Increased bonuses for computer players. These are however less useful than it would appear, as the AI tends to waste them.
  * Increased penalties for the human player. In general, penalising the human will produce better results than supporting the AI. Combat, IC and TC penalties are especially useful in forcing the human player to devise better ways of utilising limited resources rather than just wearing the opponent out. Indeed, should the war turn into a war of attrition, the human player will almost certainly be defeated, regardless of which nation he controls.

Despite these efforts, it is unfortunately still relatively easy to win the game, as the AI is unable to react adequately to a number of tactics. Players looking for a challenging game will have to adopt a set of house rules that are not enforceable by the game engine. The following section lists a number of suggestions.
  * Limit province IC to 3 * province manpower. This is intended to prevent the achievement of an overwhelming industrial advantage and useful only for the lower difficulty settings. On the highest difficulty setting, the human player will be unable to construct a significant number of factories anyway and the rule is not needed.
  * Do not perform air missions resulting in direct strength losses. This rule forbids the human player from performing ground attack and naval strike operations. Both types of missions are heavily penalised in the mod, nonetheless it is still possible to inflict irrecoverable manpower losses upon the enemy and the AI in general is very poor at maintaining, or even trying to maintain, air superiority over the battlefield.
  * No encirclements larger than 3 provinces. This is a major exploit where hundreds of divisions can be cut off and starved in implausible encirclements (eg. cutting of Caucasus by striking from Rostov to Astrakhan) and the AI is incapable of preventing them.
  * No deep penetrations. Related to the previous point, once an armored breakthrough is achieved, the AI's ability to oppose the human player deteriorates rapidly. Do not advance too deep, too fast. Give the AI a chance to adjust.
  * Do not assume military control of your allies, no matter how unwisely they are acting. The enemy AI is not performing any wiser. If your ally is collapsing, send an expeditionary force instead.
  * Do not try to force the AI into disadvantageous trade deals. Make all trade offers at 100% chance of acceptance only.
  * Maintain a well rounded armed force. This will dilute both research effort and industrial spending to only marginally useful units (eg. a surface fleet or a strategic bomber force for Germany) giving the AI a chance to catch up.
  * Commit to the rocket and nuclear research programs. Similarly to the previous point, these will waste a huge amount of industrial capacity and researcher time with only marginal benefits to the player, giving the AI more breathing room.
  * Do not use nuclear weapons once produced however.
